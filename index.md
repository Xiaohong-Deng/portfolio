### Iterative Crowdsourcing Comprehension Game

![alt text][image1]

[ICCG][0] is an online web game for understanding human comprehension. The project was supervised by the game author.

### OpenCV Lane Detection

![alt text][image2]

[Lane Detection][1] is an OpenCV based application that employs various traditional computer vision techniques including view warping and covolutions. When you combine it with YOLO darknet you get the following. Pretty cool, huh? Click on it to see the whole video.

### Highway Path Planning

[![alt text][image4]][3]

[Path Planning][4] generates trajectories for ego car every 1/15 to 1/30 second to ensure safe driving with no collision.

### Model Predictive Controller

![alt text][image5]

After trajectory is generated, How do you control the throttle and steering angle to execute it? [MPC][5] to the rescue.
